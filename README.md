## Preface
The music industry is a very old machine that was build by the hard work of both professionals and hobbyist from all over the world. The collection music was compiled over millions of years by all types of beings and energies.
In the ancient world, deities formed the morals of society and gave man kind hope. Those symbols of hope were sometimes referred to as Gods and Goddesses and they gave birth to mighty men and women which are referred to as Kings and Queens. Respect was paid to them by the offering of valuables, money and food as these sepreme entities were and still are highly exaulted.
